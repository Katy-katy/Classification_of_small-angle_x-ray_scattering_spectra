I am working on Small-angle X-ray scattering classification problem. My goal is to automate creating labels for plots of small-angle x-ray scattering spectra using **supervised or unsupervised learning**.

## The PAWS project in a nutshell:  
* data analysis at SSRL presents a bottleneck. 
* Researchers spend too much time writing and debugging their scripts. Many of these scripts are written in such a way that they are too specific to ever be used again. Many of them are written inefficiently or with unmitigated errors, and often with no attention to modularity or extensibility. 
* Our researchers' time is too valuable for this, so my job is to open up the bottleneck and make data analysis easier, faster, more extensible to new methods, more transparent and traceable, and above all, error-free.

Paws (“Platform for Automated Workflows by SSRL”) was invited as a fast and robust tool for analysing of  x-ray scattering spectra.
